Hi my name is 0xE0-rng and this is my attempt of publishing the projects that take up my free time. 

I am currently working in London as a Penetration Tester with alot of experience in mobile security, but I am always learning and have too many interests for my own good.

You can find me on mastodon as @0xE0_rng@infosec.exchange.
